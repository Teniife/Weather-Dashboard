# Weather-Dashboard

5 Day Weather Forecast

## Desccription

This weekly challenge was to creat a weather dashboard where you could type a city into the search bar and then get results showing the current date, and weather conditions for that city. The search city are also saved to your local variable as buttons so you can easily access your previos searched cities.

## Installation

No source code was provided because this was made from scratch. I used the open weather map API to fetch the weather data to display on the website. I also used the Chrome Developer Colorpick Eyedropper to get the right colors for the the website as displayed in the mock-up for the challenge.
